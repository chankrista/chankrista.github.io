I am a recent grad of the University of Chicago's MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy and now work as a data scientist at the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/). Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant at the [UCSF Institute for Health Policy Studies](https://healthpolicy.ucsf.edu/philip-r-lee-institute-health-policy-studies) and worked on healthcare analytics for [The Chartis Group](https://www.chartis.com/).

Outside of work, I have enjoyed mentoring youth with the [Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants (CERI)](https://www.cerieastbay.org/) and [Chinese Mutual Aid Association](https://www.chinesemutualaid.org/). I also look for opportunities to contribute to civic tech projects that I find interesting.
